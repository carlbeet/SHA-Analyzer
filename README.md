# SHA-Analyzer

This hashing algorithm encodes a string as a unique 160-bit hash value which cannot be reversed!
A hash creates a signature, or digital fingerprint through a series of bitwise operations and arithmetic. The algorithm itself is rather simple but computationally expensive to execute because the key is . 

Collisions:
If there are infinitely many passwords and only 2^160 unique hashes, there are guaranteed collisions
